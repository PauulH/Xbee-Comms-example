# Xbee continous comms example 
This is my attempt at writing some simple code for communicating between 2 x Xbee radios.<br /> 
I have the master and slave code set up on 2 seperate Teensy 4.0's. The radios are Xbee Pro's but I think this would work on any Xbee radio thats in transparent mode.<br />

Transmission rate is controlled in the master. There is also a timer based kick starter that gets the process started. <br />
Probably plenty of other ways to do this but hey.
